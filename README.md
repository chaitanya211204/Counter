# Counter

This javascript project will perform basically two operations..
a. increase/decrease/reset the counter\
b. change the background color as per the status of counter

This javascript project will work using DOM manipulation

If the number is negative, the background color will get changed and the same goes whether the number is positive or zero.

Thanks!!
